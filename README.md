# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

All critera should be me, and up to date. I renamed some dev to be semantically correct, while eliminating redunancies on the css file. All links are functioal as well, a `id="search=engine-optimization"` was added to correct this. Notes of changes are in the file. Also changed the class= Name for the imgages linking to the navigation bar, to help reduce redundancies in the css file. 

## User Story

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
